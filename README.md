# NodeJsMessagesApi

Http Api to send and retrieve messages based on Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.

# Installation

## In a Windows environment:

- Make sure you have npm installed in your machine and added to the path.
- Download the project.
- In the root of the project, run the powershell script install.ps1.

## In other environments:

I have not tested it in different environments, but as far as I know, I have not used any windows specific feature or module. So:

- Make sure you have npm installed and added to the path.
- Download the project.
- Go to the common folder and run 
  - `npm install`
- Go to the server project and run
  - `npm ln ../common`
  - `npm install`
